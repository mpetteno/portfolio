{{< link href="https://adventofcode.com/" title="Advent of Code" target="_blank" >}} is an annual event that takes
place every December, where participants solve a series of programming puzzles. Each puzzle is released daily, starting
on December 1st and continuing through December 25th. The puzzles cover a wide range of topics, from algorithms and
data structures to mathematical problems and optimization challenges.

Around the Job (hello Daft Punk), is a web app I built to assist with my job search. Over the 
past few years, I collected data about companies I was interested in and decided to display them on an interactive map 
for easy navigation. This project reflects my belief that we should first choose a place where we’d love to live and 
then look for a job we’re passionate about in that area. The frontend is implemented using
{{< link href="https://vuejs.org/" title="Vue.js" target="_blank" >}} and the map is handled with 
{{< link href="https://leafletjs.com/" title="Leaflet" target="_blank" >}}, while the database is managed with
{{< link href="https://firebase.google.com/" title="Firebase" target="_blank" >}}.
