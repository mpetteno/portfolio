I bring years of experience in software development, architecture, and DevOps, primarily through consultancy roles 
within the {{< link href="https://www.arsenalia.group/" title="Arsenalia Group" target="_blank" >}}, which includes the 
companies {{< link href="https://www.alpenite.com/en/" title="Alpenite" target="_blank" >}} and
{{< link href="https://www.ccelera.com/" title="ccelera" target="_blank" >}}.

My work has focused on full-stack development, especially on the SAP Hybris Commerce platform, where I delivered B2B 
and CRM solutions, integrated ticketing and notification systems, and developed mobile capabilities with PWA frameworks. 
I also took on responsibilities in software architecture, collaborating with international teams and working in London 
to implement logistics and retail integrations through Mulesoft middleware, using AMQP and REST/SOAP APIs.
In my role at ccelera, I continued my full-stack development on SAP Hybris Commerce, working closely with 
high-profile clients to deliver tailored e-commerce solutions.

Additionally, at {{< link href="https://www.walit.it/" title="Walit" target="_blank" >}}, I expanded my expertise in 
cloud infrastructure by designing and maintaining Google Cloud environments for deep learning projects, setting up 
CI/CD pipelines in Gitlab, and ensuring application security with OWASP ZAP.
