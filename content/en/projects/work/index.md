I bring years of experience in software development, architecture, and DevOps, primarily through consultancy roles 
within the {{< link href="https://www.arsenalia.group/" title="Arsenalia Group" target="_blank" >}}, which includes the 
companies Alpenite and ccelera.

My work has focused on full-stack development, especially on the SAP Hybris Commerce platform, where I delivered B2B 
and CRM solutions, integrated ticketing and notification systems, and developed mobile capabilities with PWA frameworks. 
I also took on responsibilities in software architecture, collaborating with international teams and working in London 
to implement logistics and retail integrations through Mulesoft middleware, using AMQP and REST/SOAP APIs.
In my role at ccelera s.r.l., I continued my full-stack development on SAP Hybris Commerce, working closely with 
high-profile clients to deliver tailored e-commerce solutions. 

Additionally, at Walit s.r.l., I expanded my expertise in cloud infrastructure by designing and maintaining Google Cloud 
environments for deep learning projects, setting up CI/CD pipelines in Gitlab, and ensuring application security with 
OWASP ZAP.
