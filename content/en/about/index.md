I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie PhD Student in the 
{{< link href="https://psst-doctoralnetwork.eu/" title="Privacy for Smart Speech Technology" target="_blank" >}} Doctoral Network.
The PSST project addresses the privacy risks posed by voice‑based interfaces and works towards privacy‑enhancing
speech solutions that align with EU laws like the GDPR and the AI Act.

As Fellow 2 of the program my PhD is jointly hosted by EURECOM and Ruhr‑Universität Bochum and my research focuses on disentangled 
representations for selective attribute suppression in smart speech technologies: developing deep‑learning methods to 
allow users to control which voice attributes (e.g., age, gender, dialect, health‑related cues, emotion) are disclosed 
or suppressed in speech interactions, while maintaining necessary utility for applications.

I hold a Master’s in Music & Acoustic Engineering from the 
{{< link href="https://www.polimi.it/en/education/laurea-magistrale-programmes/programme-detail/music-and-acoustic-engineering" title="Politecnico di Milano" target="_blank" >}} 
and a Bachelor’s in Information Engineering from the 
{{< link href="https://bestr.it/award/show/fmGz2P-jTbOE9qguGcwqmA" title="University of Padova" target="_blank" >}}. 
Professionally I have worked as a full‑stack developer, software architect  and DevOps engineer.

I am open to internship opportunities in related fields during my PhD. Feel free to
