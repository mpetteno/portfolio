I am engineer with a strong background in information theory and my passion for music led me to obtain a
degree in Music and Acoustic Engineering. Throughout my education, I have developed knowledge in machine
learning, system and control theory, signal processing and electronics. I have always managed to combine my
academic career with my professional development, working as a consultant in the IT sector in the role of
full-stack developer, software architect and DevOps engineer. For this reason, I consider myself a determined
person who works hard to achieve the goals he has set for himself. Iâ€™m seeking a role in the context of AI as a
machine learning or data engineer that allows me to enhance my skills in this exciting fields.
