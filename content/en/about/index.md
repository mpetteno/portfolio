I am an engineer with a strong foundation in information theory from my Bachelor’s at the 
{{< link href="https://bestr.it/award/show/fmGz2P-jTbOE9qguGcwqmA" title="University of Padova" target="_blank" >}} 
and a deep passion for audio, which led me to a Master’s in Music and Acoustic Engineering at 
{{< link href="https://www.polimi.it/en/education/laurea-magistrale-programmes/programme-detail/music-and-acoustic-engineering" title="Politecnico di Milano" target="_blank" >}}. 
I gained expertise in deep learning, signal processing, and electronics and worked professionally as a full-stack 
developer, software architect, and DevOps engineer. In September 2025, I will begin a Marie Skłodowska-Curie PhD with 
a focus on {{< link href="https://psst-doctoralnetwork.eu/" title="Privacy for Smart Speech Technology" target="_blank" >}}, 
jointly hosted by EURECOM and Ruhr-Universität Bochum.
During my PhD, I am actively seeking research or industrial internship opportunities in related fields. Feel free to
